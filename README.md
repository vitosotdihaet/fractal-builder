# Fractal builder on python

You can create complicated fractals from simple shapes with python and tkinter! All you need to do is draw a shape in the right canvas with LMB, 
change the amount of iterations (recommended is 50 divided by the number of dots in your shape, though you can change it around and see what happens) 
and press button `Build fractal`!
